# Bayesian Cross-Match to Gaia DR2 Sources

The repository provides the code used to calculate the Bayesian probability of a subset of Gaia sources to another photometric catalog. Additionally, an example use of the code is provided in the form of a Jupyter Notebook. As a note, this work is from Medan, Lepine and Hartman (2021). Before using this code, please read this paper to understand the assumptions made in this method. Additionally, using this code requires pre-querying an external catalog (as outlined in Medan, Lepine and Hartman (2021)) and formatting the data as stated in the example Jupyter Notebook.

If you use any of this code to match data used in a subsequent study, please cite Medan, Lepine and Hartman (2021).
